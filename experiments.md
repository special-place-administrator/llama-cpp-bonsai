## Done

### 1. Register centroid LUT
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed
**Result**: Eliminated constant memory serialization in FA inner loop. Precompute `centroid[i] * norm` in float registers. Fixed the context scaling regression TheTom was debugging.

### 2. Batch uint32_t 3-bit unpack (turbo4)
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed
**Result**: Single 32-bit load for 8 elements instead of per-element byte manipulation.

### 3. V_DOT2 half2 accumulation path
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed (AMD)
**Result**: On AMD GPUs with `v_dot2_f32_f16`, accumulate K dot products using half2 pairs via `ggml_cuda_mad`.

### 4. turbo4 V dequant optimization
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed
**Result**: Register LUT + batch qs/signs loads for V dequantization.

### 5. Norm correction (turbo3 + turbo4)
**Status**: done
**Type**: quality (zero decode cost)
**Result**: Store `original_norm / ||reconstruction||` instead of `original_norm`. turbo4 PPL now *beats* q8_0 (5.8186 vs 5.8375).

### 6. fp16 centroid LUT (TheTom, upstream 654647aac)
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed
**Result**: +6-14% decode at long context. Superseded by our register LUT.

### 7. Float norm broadcast (TheTom, upstream aa6a3a180)
**Status**: done
**Type**: speed
**Result**: +2-3% decode over fp16 LUT.

## Ready to Test

### 8. Layer-adaptive mode 2 (last 8 layers q8_0)
**Status**: done — **validated**
**Type**: quality + speed
**Result**: LA-2 turbo3: PPL 5.8140 (-0.40%), 97.7% decode speed. LA-2 turbo4: PPL 5.8077 (-0.51%), 96.7% decode speed. Both beat uniform turbo AND q8_0 in quality. Matches Tom's findings. **LA-2 turbo3 is the recommended config** (best quality/compression/speed balance).

### 9. Layer-adaptive mode 1 (first 4 + last 4 q8_0)
**Status**: done — **best PPL tested!**
**Type**: quality
**Result**: LA-1 turbo3: PPL 5.7958 (-0.71% vs q8_0), 97.7% decode speed. Beats LA-2 turbo3 (5.8140) by 0.31%. Protecting BOTH early residual stream and final output layers is better than just the last 8. Same compression ratio and speed as LA-2 since both use 8 q8_0 layers.

### 10. Asymmetric K/V combinations
**Status**: done — **mixed results**
**Type**: quality/speed
**Results**:
  - turbo4-K + q8_0-V: PPL 5.8451 (+0.13%), 98.2% speed — fast but slightly worse than q8_0
  - q8_0-K + turbo3-V: PPL 5.8451 (+0.13%), 98.8% speed — fastest config tested
  - turbo4-K + turbo3-V: PPL 5.8653 (+0.48%) — worst combo
  - turbo3-K + turbo4-V: PPL 5.8212 (-0.28%) — good! Values need more precision
**Surprise**: "More for Keys, Less for Values" paper prediction was WRONG for this model. turbo3-K + turbo4-V beats turbo4-K + turbo3-V by 0.76% PPL. Values matter more on Qwen3.5 27B.
**Note**: All asymmetric turbo+q8 combos have slightly worse PPL than pure q8_0. The norm correction gives uniform turbo an edge that mixing with uncorrected q8_0 dilutes.

### 11. Layer-adaptive + asymmetric combined
**Status**: done — **NEGATIVE RESULT**
**Type**: quality
**Branch**: `experiment/attention-sink-protection`
**What**: Decouple K/V in the adaptive logic. Since experiment 10 showed values matter more than keys on Qwen3.5 27B, tested promoting only V or only K to q8_0 on sensitive layers.
**Results**:
  - Mode 6 (V-only q8_0 last 8): PPL 5.8390 (+0.03%) — WORSE than uniform turbo3
  - Mode 7 (K-only q8_0 last 8): PPL 5.8390 (+0.03%) — identical to mode 6
  - Mode 8 (V-only q8_0 first2+last2): PPL 5.8330 (-0.08%) — ~= uniform
**Finding**: Promoting only one of K/V hurts quality due to norm correction mismatch between turbo and q8_0 within the same layer. K vs V makes no difference. Both must be promoted together (mode 2: 5.8140) for the quality improvement to work.

### 11b. Layer-adaptive modes 3, 4, 5 — isolation tests
**Status**: done
**Type**: quality
**Results** (all turbo3):
  - Mode 3 (last 4 only): PPL 5.8091 (-0.49%), 4 layers q8_0, ~4.2x compression
  - Mode 4 (first 4 only): PPL 5.8211 (-0.28%), 4 layers q8_0, ~4.2x compression
  - Mode 5 (first 2 + last 2): PPL 5.8091 (-0.49%), 4 layers q8_0, ~4.2x compression
**Key insight**: Mode 3 = Mode 5 (same PPL). The last 2 layers are the critical ones — protecting them dominates. The first 4 layers contribute less than the last 4. Mode 5 is the sweet spot for max compression: only 4 layers q8_0 yet still beats q8_0 by 0.49%.

### 11e. Extreme context test (65K+)
**Status**: done
**Type**: VRAM / speed
**Result**: All turbo configs fit at 65K on 24GB RTX 3090 (~22.2-22.3 GiB). Decode speed at 65K is virtually identical to 32K — zero degradation. LA-1 turbo3: 29.98 tok/s, LA-5 turbo3: 29.90, turbo4: 29.51. q8_0 would OOM at this context length (~28+ GiB needed).

---

### 16. Prefill dequant-then-attend (dequant to fp16 + MMA)
**Status**: done — **turbo3 + turbo4**
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**Branch**: `experiment/prefill-dequant-attend`
**Result**: turbo3 prefill 631→1125 tok/s (1.78x, 98.8% of q8_0). turbo4 prefill 588→1113 tok/s (1.9x, 98.1% of q8_0).
**turbo4 note**: QJL correction (~0.001 magnitude) rounds away in fp16 temp buffer. turbo4 prefill PPL 5.8966 vs 5.8186 full precision (+1.3%). Accepted tradeoff: only prompt tokens affected, generated tokens use full-precision SET_ROWS.
**Bug fixed**: turbo4 dequant_f16 kernel had missing block indexing for ne0 > QK_TURBO4 (Qwen3.5-27B has head_dim=256).

### 16b. turbo4 prefill — accepted fp16 tradeoff
**Status**: done — **ENABLED, 1.9x prefill speedup**
**Type**: speed (prefill, turbo4 only)
**What**: Enabled fp16 dequant + MMA for turbo4 prefill. QJL loses ~1% PPL precision in fp16 round-trip, but 2x prefill speedup is worth it since only prompt tokens are affected.
**Result**: turbo4 pp4096 = 1113 tok/s (was 588). PPL 5.8966 (all-prefill worst case). Real inference quality between 5.82-5.90 depending on prompt/generation ratio.

## Needs Research — Prefill Speed (SOLVED: 98.8% of q8_0, deprioritized)

### 12. BitDecoding-style MMA kernel with dequant pipelining
**Status**: needs-research
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**Paper**: BitDecoding (HPCA 2026, arXiv:2503.18773), open source at github.com/OpenBitSys/BitDecoding
**What**: First system using Tensor Cores for low-bit KV cache decoding. Register-level software pipeline: while tensor cores execute `mma.sync` on tile N, CUDA cores dequant tile N+1. Drops dequant overhead from 40-50% to 15%. Uses `lop3` PTX for bit manipulation + `ldmatrix` for TC layout.
**Performance**: 7.5x on RTX4090, 4.8x on A100, 8.9x on H100 vs FP16.
**How it applies**: Turbo dequant (bit extract + LUT + norm multiply) is pure ALU — ideal for overlapping with MMA. Turbo3's split qs+signs layout maps well to `lop3`. This is the most promising path to fix our prefill gap.
**Difficulty**: High (3-4 weeks). Need to restructure fattn-mma to add dequant pipeline stage.

### 13. SageAttention INT8 intermediate path
**Status**: needs-research
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**Paper**: SageAttention (ICLR 2025), SageAttention2 (ICML 2025), github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention
**What**: Quantize Q,K to INT8 before attention matmul, use INT8 tensor cores (`mma u8.u8.s32`) which have 2x throughput of FP16 MMA on Ampere. K smoothing (subtract mean) exploits softmax shift-invariance.
**How it applies**: Instead of dequanting turbo3/4 to FP16 for MMA, dequant to INT8 and use INT8 TC. Path: load turbo block → bitfield extract → codebook lookup → quantize to INT8 → feed INT8 MMA.
**Risk**: Double-quantization (turbo → INT8) may accumulate error. Need PPL validation.
**Difficulty**: Medium-High (2-3 weeks). Could make prefill *faster* than q8_0.

### 14. TurboMind 3-stage software pipeline
**Status**: needs-research
**Type**: speed (prefill + decode)
**Paper**: LMDeploy TurboMind (arXiv:2508.15601)
**What**: Explicitly overlaps 3 stages: (1) TC execute `mma.sync` on current tile, (2) INT/FP ALU dequant next tile, (3) `cp.async` prefetch subsequent tile. 61% latency reduction, 156% throughput improvement.
**How it applies**: Same principle as BitDecoding but more explicitly structured. Our fattn-mma already uses `cp.async` — the missing piece is inserting a dequant stage between load and MMA.
**Difficulty**: Medium-High (2-3 weeks).

### 15. Shared memory KV block caching (prefill)
**Status**: needs-research
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**What**: During prefill, multiple query tokens access the same KV positions. Dequantize a KV block once into shared memory, all query threads read from it.
**Challenge**: Shared memory is ~48KB/SM. A turbo4 block = 128 floats = 512 bytes dequantized. Balance cache size vs occupancy.
**Difficulty**: Medium (1-2 weeks).

### 16 (original). ~~Prefill-specific dequant-then-attend~~
**Status**: done — **superseded by #16 above** (turbo3 1125 tok/s, 98.8% of q8_0)

---

## Needs Research — Decode Speed (polish: 95-97% → parity)

### 17. Split-K / FlashDecoding tuning for turbo decode
**Status**: done — **NO EFFECT** (see #49)
**Type**: speed (decode)
**Papers**: FlashDecoding (Stanford), FlashDecoding++ (MLSys 2024)
**Result**: Tested via #49 (GGML_PARALLEL_BLOCKS override). All parallel_blocks values 1-32 produce identical decode speed (~29.95 tok/s). Attention is <5% of decode time — FFN dominates. The remaining 2.8% turbo3→q8_0 gap is structural and can't be closed by attention tuning. Items 3-5 (nbatch_fa, stream_k, async softmax) also won't help since attention isn't the bottleneck.

### 18. SAS softmax optimization
**Status**: dropped — **attention <5% of decode, prefill already 98.8%**
**Type**: speed (both)
**Paper**: TurboAttention (Microsoft, arXiv:2412.08585)
**What**: Decompose `exp(-x) = LUT(-x_int) * polynomial(-x_dec)`, polynomial runs on tensor cores in FP16.
**Finding**: 5-15% attention speedup × <5% attention share = <0.75% total throughput gain. Not worth the complexity. Prefill already at 98.8% of q8_0. Only revisit if targeting attention-heavy workloads (very long context decode on MoE models).

### 25b. Sign+magnitude encoding for turbo3 dequant
**Status**: done — **NEUTRAL** (no measurable speedup)
**Type**: speed (decode)
**Branch**: `experiment/sign-magnitude-encoding`
**What**: Remap turbo3's 3-bit index from {low2, high1} → {mag_idx, sign_bit}. Dequant uses 4-entry magnitude LUT + conditional negate instead of 8-entry centroid LUT. Halves register LUT pressure.
**Results**:
  - PPL: 5.8501 (identical to baseline with MMA prefill)
  - Decode 4K: 30.05 tok/s (baseline ~30.04 = no change)
  - Decode 32K: 29.91 tok/s (baseline ~29.83 = +0.3%, within noise)
**Finding**: The decode bottleneck is memory bandwidth, not ALU/register pressure from the LUT. Halving the LUT size saves ~1 instruction per element but has no measurable impact. q8_0 is 31.03 tok/s; the 3% turbo3 gap is structural.

### 25c. Long-context PPL comparison (turbo3 vs q8_0 at 4K/8K)
**Status**: done — **quality holds at long context**
**Type**: quality validation
**Results** (all 2K/8chunks unless noted):
  - 2K: turbo3 LA-1 5.7690 (-1.17%) vs q8_0 5.8375
  - 4K/4chunks: turbo3 LA-1 6.3198 (+0.83%) vs q8_0 6.2677 (turbo3 slightly worse)
  - 8K/4chunks: turbo3 LA-1 7.3952 (-0.39%) vs q8_0 7.4241 (turbo3 wins again)
  - 8K/4chunks: turbo3 uniform 7.3783 (-0.62%) vs q8_0 7.4241
**Finding**: Quality advantage is noisy across context lengths. turbo3 generally competitive with q8_0 (±0.5%). The PPL increase at longer eval is due to wikitext data (later text harder), not degradation. Error bars (±0.16-0.18) are larger than the differences.

## Needs Research — Quality Improvements

### 19. Channel reordering before FWHT
**Status**: dropped — **INCOMPATIBLE with random sign arrays**
**Type**: quality (zero decode cost)
**Paper**: RotateKV (IJCAI 2025, arXiv:2501.16383)
**What**: Sort channels by magnitude so similar-magnitude channels land in the same FWHT block.
**Research** (2026-03-27): RotateKV uses deterministic grouped-head Hadamard WITHOUT random signs. Our PolarQuant uses random sign arrays (s1, s2) that already destroy all channel magnitude structure — making reordering ineffective. Same reason GSR Walsh ordering (#39) showed no benefit. The algorithm (argsort of per-channel sum across calibration data) is simple but the prerequisite (preserved magnitude structure) doesn't hold. Code at github.com/ZunhaiSu/RotateKV. MixQuant (2601.22347) has related L1-norm balancing permutation, also assumes deterministic Hadamard.
**Conclusion**: Would only help if we switched from random PolarQuant signs to deterministic Hadamard, which would lose the decorrelation benefit that makes our codebook work well.

### 20. ~~SmoothRot — channel-wise scaling before FWHT~~
**Status**: dropped — **NOT APPLICABLE to KV cache**
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: SmoothRot (arXiv:2506.05413, Jul 2025)
**Research** (2026-03-27): SmoothRot only targets **FFN down-projection** massive outliers (>100x magnitude) in GLU architectures. It does NOT target KV cache quantization or attention projections. The paper explicitly states applying smoothing before attention layers showed "limited gains." Gains also vanish when combined with GPTQ. Not applicable to our head_dim=128 KV cache quality gap.

### 21. WUSH — data-aware transform replacing pure FWHT
**Status**: needs-research — **impractical as designed, diagonal approximation viable**
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: WUSH (arXiv:2512.00956, Nov 2025, ISTA/ETH)
**What**: T_wush = H * S^{-1/2} * U^T * W'^T. Proves Hadamard is the optimal *data-agnostic* orthogonal transform, then derives optimal *data-dependent* non-orthogonal transform.
**Research** (2026-03-27): 50-60% layer loss reduction over Hadamard on K/V projections (Qwen3-8B MXFP4). End-to-end: +2.2-2.9pp quality recovery. However, the full transform is a **dense d×d matrix-vector multiply per block** — O(d²) vs O(d log d) for FWHT. With d=128: ~16384 FMAs vs ~896 for FWHT = **18x more compute**. Also requires per-model calibration + per-block matrix storage (128×128 = 64KB per block in fp16).
**Viable path**: Their Future Work mentions a **diagonal approximation** — just per-channel scaling before FWHT, O(d) cost. This is essentially what CAT (experiment #41) achieves more cleanly.
**Difficulty**: Full WUSH = impractical. Diagonal approx = see #41 (CAT alignment correction).

### 22. NSN normalization for universal codebooks
**Status**: done — **NO BENEFIT (simplified version); FULL VERSION INCOMPATIBLE**
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: NSNQuant (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2505.18231)
**What**: Normalize-Shift-Normalize aligns token distributions to standard normal, enabling a single reusable codebook across all layers without calibration.
**Branch**: `experiment/nsnquant-dc-removal`
**Implementation**: Simplified per-token DC removal (subtract mean, renormalize before FWHT). Full NSNQuant requires batch processing (per-channel mean across 64 tokens) which is incompatible with our per-token SET_ROWS pipeline.
**Results** (2K/8chunks):
  - turbo3 baseline: PPL 5.8501 ± 0.165
  - turbo3 + DC removal: PPL 5.8827 ± 0.166 (+0.033, noise)
  - turbo4 baseline: PPL 5.8186 ± ref
  - turbo4 + DC removal: PPL 17.4134 ± 0.618 (**catastrophic** — QJL residual breaks)
**Finding**: Per-token DC removal is useless because (1) values are already near-zero-mean after L2 normalization + FWHT, (2) for V the lost DC component corrupts the output, (3) for turbo4 the QJL sign-bit correction is computed relative to the DC-removed signal but decoded without correction. Full NSNQuant requires different infrastructure (batch quantization).

### 23. Attention-sink token protection
**Status**: done — **NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT**
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: AnTKV (arXiv:2506.19505)
**What**: Keep first few tokens (attention sinks) at fp16 precision (pre-quantization), overwrite dequanted fp16 buffer before flash attention.
**Branch**: `experiment/attention-sink-protection`
**Results** (turbo3, 2K/8chunks):
  - No sink (baseline): PPL 5.8501 ± 0.165
  - N=4 sink tokens: PPL 5.8246 ± 0.164 (-0.026)
  - N=8 sink tokens: PPL 5.8506 ± 0.165 (+0.001)
  - N=16 sink tokens: PPL 5.8894 ± 0.167 (+0.039)
**Finding**: All deltas within error bars. turbo3 + FWHT + norm correction already has high enough quality that sink protection provides no measurable benefit. The attention-sink amplification of quantization error doesn't matter when the error is this small.
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium (1 week). High impact for chat/instruction-following quality.

### 24. Per-head adaptive precision
**Status**: deferred — **infra too heavy for uncertain gain**
**Type**: quality
**Papers**: KVC-Q (ScienceDirect 2026), KVTuner (ICML 2025), MixKVQ (arXiv:2512.19206)
**What**: Allocate turbo4 to sensitive heads, turbo3 to robust ones. Same average bit rate, better quality.
**Assessment** (2026-03-27): Requires per-head type in KV cache allocation (currently per-layer only). On Qwen3.5-27B, turbo3 is already +0.22% PPL — per-head won't help. On head_dim=128 models with only 2-4 KV heads, there's barely enough heads to differentiate. The layer-adaptive modes (#8-11) already capture most of this benefit with much less complexity.
**Difficulty**: High (2-3 weeks). Deferred until layer-adaptive is exhausted.

### 25. Drop QJL entirely (turbo3-only approach)
**Status**: done — **QJL HELPS, do NOT drop**
**Type**: simplification + speed
**Source**: TheTom's `turboquant_plus` (220 stars) + direct confirmation from Tom
**Branch**: `experiment/drop-qjl`
**What**: turbo4 uses 3-bit codebook + 1-bit QJL signs. Tom validated that dropping QJL and giving all bits to the codebook (4-bit Lloyd-Max, no QJL) is faster and equivalent quality. Block size 32 beats 128 for FA parallelism.
**Results** (turbo4 uniform, Qwen3.5-27B):
  - turbo4 WITH QJL: PPL 5.8186 (-0.32% vs q8_0), prefill 588 tok/s (vec only), decode 29.43
  - turbo4 NO QJL: PPL 5.8501 (+0.22% vs q8_0), prefill 1124 tok/s (MMA works!), decode 29.40
  - turbo3 (reference): PPL 5.8323 (-0.09% vs q8_0), prefill 1125 tok/s, decode 29.93
**Finding**: QJL contributes +0.3 PPL points to turbo4. Without QJL, turbo4 is slightly WORSE than turbo3 in quality (5.8501 vs 5.8323) and decode speed (29.40 vs 29.93), with worse compression (4.25 vs 3.5 bits/element). TheTom's finding may not apply when norm correction is in use — QJL + norm correction is what gives turbo4 its q8_0-beating quality.
**Benefit**: Dropping QJL DOES fix the fp16 prefill issue (1124 tok/s), but turbo3 already gets 1125 tok/s. No practical advantage over turbo3.
**Conclusion**: Keep QJL. turbo4's value proposition IS the QJL correction + norm correction combo. Without QJL, just use turbo3.

## Needs Research — Architecture / New Formats

### 26. CommVQ — RoPE-commutative codebooks
**Status**: deferred — **fundamentally different approach, not incremental**
**Type**: architecture
**Paper**: CommVQ (ICML 2025, arXiv:2506.18879, Apple/UMass)
**What**: EM-trained codebooks that commute with RoPE. Elegant but requires per-model trained codebooks and new quantization pipeline. Incompatible with our universal Lloyd-Max approach. Would be a complete rewrite, not an improvement to turbo3/4.

### 27. ~~ConvRot — group rotation instead of full-dim FWHT~~
**Status**: dropped — **failed by TheTom** (group-32 rotation: PPL 7.06 vs target 6.19)
**Paper**: ConvRot (arXiv:2512.03673, Dec 2025)
**What**: Replace full d=128 FWHT with group-of-32 Hadamard transforms. Tom tested this directly and it produces unacceptable PPL. Full d=128 rotation is necessary for proper decorrelation.

### 36. Temporal decay — progressive 3→2 bit requantization
**Status**: unblocked — turbo2 implemented (#28), needs per-position type tracking infra
**Type**: quality + memory
**Source**: TheTom/turboquant_plus/benchmarks/temporal_decay_prototype.py
**What**: Old tokens requantized turbo3→turbo2. ~30% extra memory savings.
**Prerequisites**: GGML_TYPE_TURBO2_0 now available (#28). Still needs per-position type tracking in KV cache. turbo2 benchmark data (PPL 6.78 uniform, +8% vs f16) suggests this may only be viable for tokens >16K positions back where attention weights are negligible.
**Updated assessment** (2026-03-27): Given turbo2's +8% uniform PPL hit, temporal decay would need to be very selective about which tokens to demote. May combine well with sparse V dequant (#51) — if attention weight is <1e-6, the requantization error doesn't matter.

### 28. turbo2 (2-bit) variant
**Status**: done — IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
**Type**: new format
**What**: turbo2 = 2.5 bpv = 6.4x compression vs fp16. 2-bit PolarQuant (4-centroid Lloyd-Max), no QJL correction.
**Results** (2026-03-27, Qwen3.5-27B head_dim=256, 4K ctx, 4 chunks):
- turbo2 K+V: PPL 6.78 (+8.0% vs f16) — too much degradation for general use
- turbo3-K + turbo2-V: PPL 6.57 (+4.6%) — mixed is much better
- turbo2-K + turbo3-V: PPL 6.52 (+3.9%) — K matters more for quality
- turbo2-K + q8_0-V: PPL 6.49 (+3.4%) — best turbo2 combo
- Speed: identical to turbo3 (~30.6 tg128, compute-bound)
- KV memory: 20 MiB vs 28 MiB (turbo3) vs 128 MiB (f16) at 4K
**Conclusion**: turbo2 works but +8% PPL is too high for uniform K+V. Best use case is mixed turbo2-K/turbo3-V (3.9% gap at ~2.9 bpv average) or as part of layer-adaptive decay (#27). The 90% compression cliff warning from "Physics of KV Compression" paper was validated — turbo2 at 87.5% compression is indeed at the quality edge.
**Difficulty**: Medium (implemented in 1 session, 22 files modified).

### 29. Blackwell native FP4/FP6 tensor cores
**Status**: needs-research (hardware dependent)
**Type**: speed (future)
**Paper**: NVIDIA Blackwell `tcgen05.mma` with mixed FP4/FP6/FP8 inputs
**What**: On B200/RTX5090, turbo3's 3-bit values could be zero-padded to 4-bit and use native FP4 tensor cores. Eliminates dequant bottleneck entirely for Q*K matmul.
**Difficulty**: Medium (when targeting Blackwell). Long-term path.

### 30. Dynamic quantization switching at VRAM thresholds
**Status**: deferred — **complex, better solved by layer-adaptive modes**
**Type**: quality + memory
**What**: Auto-switch q8_0→turbo at VRAM pressure. Our layer-adaptive modes (#8-11) already provide the quality/compression tradeoff. Dynamic switching would add runtime complexity for marginal benefit over pre-configured layer-adaptive.

### 31. Turbo types in speculative decoding draft model
**Status**: done — **NO PRACTICAL BENEFIT**
**Type**: speed + memory
**What**: Draft models use `-ctkd`/`-ctvd` flags. turbo3 on draft KV saves VRAM.
**Results** (Qwen3.5-2B Q4_K_M draft → Qwen3.5-27B Q6_K target, n=256, draft=8):
  - q8_0 draft KV: 28.78 tok/s, n_drafted=1864
  - turbo3 draft KV: 28.85 tok/s, n_drafted=1936
  - Normal decode (no spec): ~31 tok/s
**Finding**: (1) Speculative decoding is slower than normal decode for this model pair — the 2B draft has poor acceptance rate. (2) turbo3 on draft KV has zero impact on throughput or acceptance because the 2B model's KV cache is negligible compared to the 27B target. turbo KV matters for the target model (which already uses it), not the draft.
**Conclusion**: turbo in speculative decoding is a non-issue. The draft KV is tiny and turbo3 doesn't affect acceptance rate.

### 32. Fused quantization in QKV projection
**Status**: deferred — **prefill already 98.8%, not worth the complexity**
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**Paper**: TurboAttention FlashQ (Microsoft, arXiv:2412.08585)
**What**: Fuse turbo quantization into the QKV projection pass rather than as a separate SET_ROWS step.
**Finding**: SET_ROWS is already negligible vs attention+FFN compute. Prefill at 98.8% of q8_0. Deep ggml graph integration not justified.

### 33. Entropy coding for stored/offloaded caches
**Status**: deferred — **storage-only, no quality/speed impact**
**Type**: compression (storage)
**Paper**: KVTC (NVIDIA, ICLR 2026, arXiv:2511.01815)
**What**: Arithmetic/Huffman coding on codebook indices for ~0.3-0.5 extra bits savings. Only helps disk storage/CPU offload. Revisit when prefix caching becomes a feature.

### 34. Cross-layer codebook sharing / delta coding
**Status**: deferred — **complex dependency, uncertain benefit**
**Type**: compression
**Paper**: XQuant (arXiv:2510.11236)
**What**: We already share a single codebook across all layers. Delta coding (encode layer N as delta from N-1) would add cross-layer dependency in the critical path — bad for pipeline parallelism. The benefit is extra compression, but we're already at 3.5 bpv which is sufficient.

### 35. HCAttention — values on CPU, keys on GPU
**Status**: deferred — **major arch change, future feature**
**Type**: memory (extreme context)
**Paper**: HCAttention (arXiv:2507.19823)
**What**: CPU-offloaded V with GPU-only K for extreme context (4M tokens). Good synergy with turbo-compressed K. Requires major architectural changes to attention pipeline.

### 37. MSE-optimal norm correction
**Status**: done — **NEGATIVE RESULT**
**Type**: quality
**What**: Replace L2-preserving norm correction (β = ||x||/||q||) with MSE-optimal scaling (α = ||x|| · dot(x,q) / ||q||²). Theoretically halves per-element MSE.
**Result**: turbo3 PPL 5.9083 vs baseline 5.8501 (+0.058, slightly WORSE). MSE-optimal reduces norm by cos(θ), lowering effective attention temperature. L2-preserving is better for attention.

### 38. Multi-model validation + KV cache context OOM fix
**Status**: done — **BUG FIX + QUALITY DATA**
**Type**: quality, bugfix
**Bug**: ggml context allocation for KV cache didn't account for turbo rotation matrix tensors (2 extra objects). Caused assertion failure on all non-Qwen3.5 models.
**Fix**: Add `n_turbo_extra` (4 tensors) to context size in `llama-kv-cache.cpp`.
**Quality results** (turbo3 uniform, 2K context):
  - Qwen3.5-27B Q6_K: +0.2% (excellent)
  - Qwen3.5-35B-A3B MoE Q4_K_S: +0.3% (excellent)
  - MN-Violet-Lotus-12B Q4_K_M: +2.6% (acceptable)
  - Qwen3-14B Q5_K_M: +3.8% (moderate degradation)
  - Gemma-3-27B-it Q4_K_M: turbo3 K+V +3.3%, turbo3-K +4.6% (V was broken pre-#45 fix)
**Key finding**: turbo3 quality degrades on head_dim=128 models (~3% PPL increase) vs head_dim=256 models (<0.3%). Gemma-3 V is completely broken due to SWA/global hybrid cache architecture. Needs investigation.

## New Experiments (from March 2026 research)

### 39. GSR Walsh ordering for FWHT
**Status**: done — **NEUTRAL** (no measurable improvement)
**Type**: quality (zero cost)
**Paper**: GSR (arXiv:2505.03810, ACL 2025 SRW)
**Branch**: `experiment/gsr-walsh-ordering`
**What**: Reorder FWHT output by sequency (sign-change count) using permutation `perm[s] = bit_reverse_7(gray(s))`. Groups similar-frequency components into the same turbo3 quantization block (32 elements within 128-element FWHT group).
**Results** (turbo3 uniform, 2K/8chunks):
  - turbo3 baseline: PPL 5.8323
  - turbo3 + Walsh ordering: PPL 5.8248 (-0.13%, within error bars ±0.164)
  - q8_0 reference: PPL 5.8375
**Finding**: GSR paper's massive gains (PPL 20.29→11.59) were without random sign arrays. Our PolarQuant rotation uses random signs (s1, s2) that already decorrelate all 128 output elements, making them identically distributed. Sequency reordering cannot improve intra-block variance when the signs already destroy frequency structure. Walsh ordering only helps fixed (non-randomized) Hadamard transforms.

### 40. Mean-centering before FWHT (HadaNorm)
**Status**: dropped — **duplicate of #22, incompatible with per-token quantization**
**Type**: quality (minimal cost)
**Paper**: HadaNorm (arXiv:2506.09932, Jun 2025)
**What**: Per-channel mean subtraction before Hadamard. Two interpretations: (a) per-token mean of 128-element group = what #22 tested (no benefit — already near-zero after L2 norm), (b) per-channel mean across tokens (requires calibration or running statistics, incompatible with per-token SET_ROWS pipeline). Same fundamental issue as #39: random sign arrays already decorrelate the distribution, making pre-centering redundant.

### 41. CAT alignment correction / per-channel scaling
**Status**: done — **CLOSED, theoretically cannot help**
**Type**: quality
**Papers**: CAT (arXiv:2603.04359, Mar 2026), InnerQ (arXiv:2602.23200, Feb 2026)
**What**: CAT decomposes quantization error into concentration (outlier spread, what FWHT handles) and alignment (direction match, what FWHT does NOT handle). Alignment is INVARIANT to orthogonal rotations — FWHT cannot improve it.
**Analysis** (2026-03-27):
Our pipeline makes CAT-style interventions ineffective:
1. **L2 normalization** removes per-channel magnitude → all vectors unit norm
2. **FWHT with random signs** mixes all channels → each output position ≈ i.i.d. N(0, 1/128)
3. **Per-channel scaling before FWHT**: destroyed by mixing (FWHT is a dense linear transform)
4. **Per-channel scaling after FWHT**: meaningless — all positions have identical distribution
5. **Lloyd-Max codebook** is already optimal for the resulting standardized Gaussian
6. **Norm correction** already preserves L2 norm of reconstruction (handles magnitude alignment)
The remaining error is purely angular (codebook discretization) and cannot be reduced without more bits or a fundamentally different codebook structure. The head_dim=128 quality gap (+2-4% PPL) is a sqrt(n) noise effect in dot products — fewer dimensions means larger relative error per attention score. This is inherent to the dimensionality, not a codebook/distribution mismatch that scaling could fix.
**Closes research line**: #19 (channel reordering), #20 (SmoothRot), #39 (GSR Walsh), #40 (HadaNorm), #41 (CAT) all fail for the same root cause — random sign arrays + FWHT already make the distribution optimally uniform.
**Difficulty**: Low (heuristic test) to Medium (full calibration).

### 42. KVLinC asymmetric K/V rotation strategy
**Status**: done — **NEGATIVE RESULT** (rotation helps keys too)
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: KVLinC (arXiv:2510.05373, Oct 2025)
**Branch**: `experiment/kvlinc-no-k-rotation`
**What**: KVLinC claims rotation helps V but hurts K. Test: disable K rotation (TURBO_NO_K_ROTATE=1), keep V rotation.
**Results** (turbo3 uniform, Qwen3.5-27B, 2K/8chunks):
  - turbo3 baseline (both rotated): PPL 5.8323 (-0.09% vs q8_0)
  - turbo3 K unrotated, V rotated: PPL 6.1647 (+5.6% vs q8_0)
  - turbo3 neither rotated (prior data): PPL 6.2357 (+6.8% vs q8_0)
**Finding**: Disabling K rotation hurts PPL by +0.33 (5.83→6.16). KVLinC's finding does NOT apply to our turbo3 codebook. Their result was for 2-bit with per-channel scale+zero quantization, which is a different paradigm. Our Lloyd-Max codebook with norm correction benefits from rotation on both K and V because it makes the distribution match the codebook's symmetric assumption. The +0.07 difference between K-unrotated (6.16) and neither-rotated (6.24) shows V rotation alone contributes about half the benefit.
**Risk**: Our norm correction assumes rotation — need to verify norm correction still works on unrotated K.
**Difficulty**: Medium (1 week). Straightforward to test.

### 43. SQuat-inspired query-orthogonal codebook selection
**Status**: needs-research
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: SQuat (arXiv:2503.24358, Mar 2025, Red Hat AI)
**What**: Instead of minimizing ||k - k_quantized|| (compression error), SQuat ensures quantization residual is **orthogonal to the query subspace**. Query subspace from prompt SVD (rank ~30 for d=4096), generalizes to response tokens. 2-bit, no fine-tuning, no calibration data.
**How it applies**: After FWHT rotation makes the distribution uniform, SQuat's orthogonality constraint ensures whatever residual quantization error remains is **invisible to queries**. The prompt-derived subspace can be computed once at prompt time with no ongoing cost. Could be combined with Lloyd-Max by biasing codebook selection toward codewords whose error is orthogonal to the query subspace.
**Challenge**: O(d³) for the iterative quantization algorithm. May be too expensive for per-token SET_ROWS. A simplified version (project quantization error onto query subspace and minimize that instead of MSE) could be cheaper.
**Difficulty**: High (2-3 weeks). Strongest theoretical backing for quality improvement.
**Research completed 2026-03-27**: See detailed analysis in memory/reference_squat_algorithm_deep_dive.md. Code at github.com/Red-Hat-AI-Innovation-Team/SQuat. Key finding: O(d^2) per-token cost is trivial at d=128. Critical tension: FWHT rotation may destroy the low-rank query subspace structure SQuat exploits. Recommended: test Option B (block iterative update) first, measuring both rotated and unrotated Q subspace rank.

### 44. PatternKV — pattern subtraction before codebook
**Status**: research-complete — **LOW expected value** (FWHT already solves distribution flattening)
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: PatternKV (arXiv:2510.05176, Oct 2025). Code: github.com/HCOOOH/PatternKV (0 stars, Llama-only Python/Triton).
**Research** (2026-03-27): PatternKV mines 32 centroids via KMeans during prefill, subtracts nearest pattern before INT quantization of residual. CRITICAL INSIGHT: FWHT and PatternKV are COMPETING solutions to the same problem (distribution flattening). After our sign-randomized FWHT, post-rotation distribution is already ~Gaussian — patterns would capture little residual structure. INT2 PatternKV gains +1pt LongBench over KIVI; our FWHT+Lloyd-Max already achieves near-q8_0 quality at 3-bit.
**Feasible path**: Subtract pattern before FWHT, store pre-rotated patterns for dequant. 4 patterns × 128 floats = 2KB/head. Pattern index costs 2 bits per 128-element group.
**V has a gotcha**: 75% of V vectors benefit; the rest must skip (quality collapses without adaptive threshold).
**Expected gain**: 0-0.5% on Qwen3.5-27B (already near-optimal), maybe 0.5-2% on head_dim=128 models.
**DeltaKV**: Dropped — requires trained MLP compressor, Sparse-vLLM, incompatible with our approach.
**Difficulty**: Medium. Could prototype but expected ROI is low.

### 45. Gemma-3 SWA V cache investigation
**Status**: done — **FIXED, Gemma-3 turbo3 now works**
**Type**: quality/bugfix
**Root cause**: V inverse rotation (`ggml_turbo_wht`) was missing from the iSWA `build_attn` overload in `llama-graph.cpp`. Gemma-3 uses iSWA for ALL layers.
**Fix**: Added V un-rotation block to iSWA `build_attn` overload at ~line 2235 (after `build_attn_mha`, before W_O).
**Results** (Gemma-3-27B-it Q4_K_M, 2K/8chunks):
  - q8_0: PPL 5.6995
  - turbo3 K+V: PPL 5.8867 (+3.3%) — **was 45 TRILLION before fix**
  - turbo3-K + q8_0-V: PPL 5.9633 (+4.6%) — was reported as +31% in earlier test
**Finding**: With the fix, Gemma-3 turbo3 quality matches the head_dim=128 model pattern (+3-4% PPL), same as MN-Violet-Lotus-12B (+2.6%) and Qwen3-14B (+3.8%). K-only slightly worse than K+V, consistent with Qwen3.5 findings that V matters more.

### 50. turbo4 K broken on head_dim=128 — missing Q pre-rotation for TURBO4_0
**Status**: done — **FIXED AND VERIFIED**
**Type**: bugfix
**What**: turbo4-K produced PPL 33K on Qwen3-14B (head_dim=128). turbo4-V worked fine.
**Root cause**: In `fattn.cu` line 702, `turbo_kv` only checked `GGML_TYPE_TURBO3_0`, NOT `TURBO4_0`. This gated Q pre-rotation at line 759. turbo4 K stored rotated, but Q never got pre-rotated → garbage dot products.
**Fix applied**: Changed Q pre-rotation guard at line 759 to include TURBO4_0:
```c
const bool turbo_k_any = (K->type == GGML_TYPE_TURBO3_0 || K->type == GGML_TYPE_TURBO4_0);
if (turbo_k_any && Q->ne[0] % 128 == 0) {
```
**Results after fix**:
  - Qwen3.5-27B (head_dim=256): turbo4 K+V PPL 5.8186 (-0.32% vs q8_0) — **BEATS q8_0!**
  - Qwen3-14B (head_dim=128): turbo4 K+V PPL 6.9118 (+6.3% vs q8_0) — functional, turbo4-V still excellent (+1.9%)
  - Experiment #10's turbo4-K result (5.8451) confirmed reproducible after fix
**Mystery resolved**: Experiment #10 was probably from before FWHT rotation was implemented (no rotation = no pre-rotation needed).

### 51. Sparse V dequant (TheTom)
**Status**: done — **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**
**Type**: speed (decode)
**Credit**: TheTom (turboquant_plus/sparse-v-dequant)
**What**: Skip V dequantization for KV positions where `exp(score - max) < 1e-6`. At long context, 90%+ of attention weights are negligible.
**Implementation**: 3 lines added to fattn-vec.cuh V accumulation loop (both V_DOT2 and non-V_DOT2 paths). Threshold check after loading KQ_k, `continue` before V dequant.
**Results**: Zero quality loss (PPL bit-identical). On dense model, no speedup (attention <5% of compute). On MoE model, eliminates native dequant context scaling regression: 114.44→126.89 tok/s at 8K (+10.9%). Native dequant with sparse V now matches fp16 dequant speed at all contexts.
**Implication**: The fp16 decode dequant path may become unnecessary — sparse V achieves the same context-scaling fix with zero extra memory bandwidth.

### 46. BitDecoding-style dequant pipeline for turbo prefill
**Status**: needs-research → experiment #16b
**Type**: speed (prefill)
**Paper**: BitDecoding (HPCA 2026, arXiv:2503.18773), open source at github.com/OpenBitSys/BitDecoding
**What**: Register-level software pipeline: CUDA cores dequant tile N+1 while tensor cores MMA tile N. Uses `lop3` PTX for bit manipulation, `ldmatrix` for TC layout, XOR swizzling for bank-conflict-free shared memory. Drops dequant overhead from 40-50% to **15%**. GQA query reshape (relevant to our 24Q/4KV Qwen3.5 layout).
**Code available**: `csrc/bit_decode/` in the BitDecoding repo. C++ + CUDA, LibTorch build.
**How it applies**: Our turbo3 prefill (experiment #16) already achieves 98.8% of q8_0 via dequant-then-MMA. This would primarily benefit turbo4 prefill (currently stuck at 588 tok/s due to QJL fp16 precision loss). Inline dequant avoids the fp16 temp buffer entirely.
**Difficulty**: High (3-4 weeks). Restructure fattn-mma to add dequant pipeline stage.

### 47. ButterflyQuant — learnable O(n log n) transforms
**Status**: dropped — **NOT APPLICABLE** (weight quant only, random signs negate benefit)
**Type**: quality
**Paper**: ButterflyQuant (arXiv:2509.09679, Sep 2025, v3 Feb 2026)
**GitHub**: 42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm (8 stars, README only, NO CODE)
**What**: Replace fixed Hadamard with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. O(n log n) complexity, n*log2(n)/2 learnable params (448 for n=128). Each butterfly stage has 64 independent Givens rotations G(theta)=[[cos,-sin],[sin,cos]] at stride 2^(i-1). Uniformity regularization KL(P_bins||Uniform) for codebook utilization. Identity init (theta=0), SGD+cosine LR, 128 WikiText-2 samples, converges in 500-700 steps on single H100.
**Paper results**: W2A16 PPL 15.4 (ButterflyQuant) vs 16.43 (SpinQuant) vs 36.77 (GPTQ) on LLaMA-2-7B. Learned butterfly coherence 1.8-3.2e-2 per layer vs Hadamard's 1.56e-2.
**Why dropped**: Three fundamental blockers:
1. **Weight quant, not KV cache**: Paper optimizes rotation jointly with FIXED weight matrices. KV cache has dynamic per-token distributions — the learned rotation cannot be jointly optimized with the data it will see.
2. **Random signs already optimal**: Our S2*H*S1 pipeline achieves coherence ~1.56e-2 (Hadamard-optimal), BETTER than ButterflyQuant's learned 1.8-3.2e-2. Same reason GSR Walsh ordering (#39) showed zero benefit — random signs decorrelate all output elements, making any structured rotation improvement moot.
3. **No code, no KV validation**: GitHub repo is empty. Paper has zero KV cache experiments.
**CUDA cost if implemented**: 4 FMA per butterfly pair vs 2 add/sub for FWHT (2x compute per pass). Would need 896 twiddle factors (3.5KB) in constant memory per layer. Net: slower rotation for zero quality gain.
**Better alternative**: CAT alignment correction (#41) addresses the orthogonal "alignment" factor that our FWHT does NOT handle, rather than re-solving "concentration" that FWHT already handles optimally.

### 48. AQUA-KV — inter-layer KV prediction
**Status**: dropped — **architecturally incompatible with llama.cpp**
**Type**: quality + compression
**Paper**: AQUA-KV (arXiv:2501.19392, ICML 2025). Code: github.com/goodevening13/aquakv (19 stars, PyTorch only).
**Research** (2026-03-27): Impressive results (2-bit near-lossless) but three fundamental conflicts:
1. **Cross-layer dependency**: Requires dequanting layer L-1 KV to predict layer L. Our SET_ROWS quantizes each layer independently.
2. **Pre-RoPE requirement**: Must store pre-RoPE keys, re-apply on read. We store post-RoPE.
3. **Batch buffer model**: Accumulates 128 tokens then batch-compresses sequentially across layers. We quantize per-token.
Would require redesigning llama.cpp's entire KV cache write path. Not worth the architectural cost when our 3-bit approach already achieves near-q8_0 quality.

### 49. Tune parallel_blocks heuristic for turbo decode
**Status**: done — **NO EFFECT** (attention not the bottleneck)
**Type**: speed (decode)
**Branch**: `experiment/parallel-blocks-tuning`
**What**: Added GGML_PARALLEL_BLOCKS env var override to force different split-K values. Benchmarked all values from 1 to 32.
**Results** (turbo3 tg64 at 32K context, Qwen3.5-27B, RTX 3090):
  - default (auto): 29.95 tok/s
  - pb=1: 29.97, pb=2: 29.95, pb=4: 29.95, pb=8: 29.96, pb=16: 29.96, pb=32: 29.93
  - q8_0 baseline: 30.81 tok/s (turbo3 = 97.2%)
**Finding**: All parallel_blocks values within noise (±0.1 tok/s). Attention compute is <5% of total decode time — FFN dominates. The 2.8% turbo3-to-q8_0 gap is structural dequant overhead that can't be closed by attention-level tuning. This also applies to #17 (Split-K tuning).

### 50. Fix multi-sequence (n_seq > 1) turbo dequant
**Status**: done — **CRITICAL BUG FIX**
**Type**: correctness
**Branch**: `feature/turboquant-kv-cache`
**What**: Turbo dequant-to-fp16 kernels in fattn.cu ignored the stream dimension (ne[3]).
With kv_unified=false (the default) and n_seq > 1, K/V tensors have ne[3] = n_stream
during prefill. Only stream 0 was allocated and dequanted — streams 1+ read
uninitialized fp16 garbage, causing catastrophic PPL degradation.
**Fix**: Added ne[3]/nb[3] to kernel signatures, allocation sizes, and 3D grid launches
for all turbo dequant kernels (turbo3, turbo4) in both prefill and decode paths.
**Results**: n_seq=1: 6.31 (unchanged), n_seq=2: 6.30 (was 17.10), n_seq=4: 6.34 (was 22.56).

## Dropped

### Group-32 rotation (ConvRot)
**Reason**: TheTom tested directly. PPL 7.06 vs target 6.19. Full d=128 FWHT rotation is necessary for proper decorrelation. Smaller group sizes lose too much.

### Custom GGML_OP_TURBO_WHT as speed optimization
**Reason**: TheTom found it's a red herring — same speed as dense matmul. Q pre-rotation moved inline into FA kernels (vec: shared memory FWHT, prefill: separate kernel with persistent buffer). V un-rotation stays at graph level for CUDA graph compatibility. Decode: 30.14 tok/s (-0.4% vs baseline), PPL identical. Key fix: `cudaMallocAsync` for Q temp buffer caused NaN on graph replay — replaced with persistent `cudaMalloc`.

### Gemini's RoPE/WHT commutativity theory
**Reason**: TheTom investigated, wasn't the actual root cause of quality issues. The real constraint is simpler: WHT must be applied after RoPE, which our implementation does correctly.

### SmoothRot (#20) — channel scaling before FWHT
**Reason**: Research (2026-03-27) found SmoothRot only targets FFN down-projection outliers, NOT KV cache or attention. Paper explicitly states smoothing before attention has "limited gains." Gains also vanish with GPTQ. Not applicable to our head_dim=128 KV cache quality gap.

### WUSH full transform (#21) — data-aware dense transform
**Reason**: O(d²) per block = 18x slower than FWHT for d=128. Requires per-model calibration + per-block matrix storage (64KB/block in fp16). Diagonal approximation is the only viable path — see CAT (#41) for a cleaner version of this idea.

### PatternKV (#44) — pattern subtraction before codebook quantization `needs-research`
**Paper**: arXiv:2510.05176 (Oct 2025, v2 Jan 2026). Online k-means (32 centroids/head), subtract nearest pattern, quantize residual only.
**Results**: +1pt LongBench at INT2 over KIVI, +2.6pt GSM8K. Only 0.08% drop at INT4. +6.6% prefill latency, +2.6% decode latency.
**Analysis (2026-03-27)**: LOW expected benefit for turbo3/turbo4 because FWHT rotation already flattens the distribution (exactly what PatternKV targets). PatternKV operates on raw asymmetric INT quant without any rotation, so the "peaked distribution with outliers" problem it solves is already handled by our pipeline. Pattern subtraction in rotated space would require rotating patterns too, and rotated-space values are already approximately Gaussian where Lloyd-Max codebook is near-optimal. The V cache adaptive threshold (75% utilization, catastrophic without it) adds fragile complexity. Would need to operate pre-FWHT on raw vectors, but then pattern centroids are head_dim=128/256 floats that must be stored per-head per-layer (32 * 128 * 4B = 16KB/head, 40 layers * 4 heads = 2.56MB for Qwen3.5-27B -- fits in constant memory). **Verdict: unlikely to beat our existing FWHT flattening, but a simplified 4-pattern version is low-risk to prototype.**

### DeltaKV (#44b) — inter-token residual compression `dropped`
**Paper**: arXiv:2602.08005 (Feb 2026). Learned MLP compressor, strided reference tokens, global L2 retrieval.
**Analysis**: Requires training (~8 GPU hours per model), learned projections (MLP weights per layer), and a full framework rewrite (Sparse-vLLM). Fundamentally incompatible with our fixed-codebook approach. The per-token reference lookup is O(S) per token, not feasible in a CUDA kernel during SET_ROWS. **Verdict: wrong paradigm for llama.cpp integration.**
